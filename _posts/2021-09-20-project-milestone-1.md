title:  "Mobile App Dev Project Milestone 1"
---

The first project for my mobile app development course is to create a single view interactive iOS app. It can include apps that perform a calculation, respond to user input or selections, or respond to events in the app. We were encouraged to be creative and focus on design and user interaction.

### App Description
I will be building a complementary color generator. The user will input a color (in hexadecimal or rgb) and the app will calculate complementary colors. 
* My inspiration
    * Whenever I'm writing css or using photoshop, I constantly have to lookup complementary colors to generate a cohesive theme for my designs. I usually have a primary color I base my design around so having a way to easily generate colors would be very helpful.
* Goals
    * I want to have an app that calculates complementary colors automatically and shows how the colors would look put next to and in front of each other.

### Intended Audience
* The intended audience is designers and digital artists. 

### Similar Apps
* A website I use currently is [Adobe Color](color.adobe.com). This calculates complementary colors but I find it slow to use and requires users to sign into an account.
* There doesn't seem to be an iPhone app that calculates complementary colors.

### Sources
* I will most likely look up algorithms to calculate the complementary colors depending on how difficult I find it.
